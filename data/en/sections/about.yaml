# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a recent graduate who has interests In various fields leading me to have a double minor in Economics and Psychology. I try to incorporate some underlying principles from these fields and more into my work allowing me to think outside the box. I have previously worked on very diverse projects ranging from virtual games to more complicated endeavors like establishing an online database. I have worked on projects on my own and in both mid and large-sized groups. Through these experiences, I have had opportunities to develop interpersonal skills and my abilities with every adversity that had risen. With this in mind, I am looking to apply the skills that I have developed so far to databases and wrangling data so that I can continue to grow with those around me. I would be interested in opportunities that allow for growth and new learning opportunities the most.'
